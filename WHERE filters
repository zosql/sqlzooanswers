-- 1.The population of 'France'. Strings should be in 'single quotes';

SELECT population FROM bbc
  WHERE name = 'France'

-- 2.The names and population densities for the very large countries. We can use mathematical and string expressions as well as field names and constants.

SELECT name, population/area FROM bbc
  WHERE area > 5000000

-- 3.Where to find some very small, very rich countries. We use AND to ensure that two or more conditions hold true.

SELECT name , region
  FROM bbc
  WHERE area < 2000
    AND gdp > 5000000000

-- 4.Which of Ceylon, Iran, Persia and Sri Lanka is the name of a country? The word IN allows us to check if an item is in a list.

SELECT name FROM bbc
  WHERE name IN ('Sri Lanka', 'Ceylon',
                 'Persia',    'Iran')

-- 5.What are the countries beginning with D? The word LIKE permits pattern matching - % is the wildcard.

SELECT name FROM bbc
  WHERE name LIKE 'D%'

-- 6.Which countries are not too small and not too big? BETWEEN allows range checking - note that it is inclusive.

SELECT name, area FROM bbc
  WHERE area BETWEEN 207600 AND 244820
