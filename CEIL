-- CEIL(f) is ceiling, it returns the integer that is equal to or just more than f
-- CEIL(f) give the integer that is equal to, or just higher than f. CEIL always rounds up.
-- CEIL(2.7)  ->  3
-- CEIL(-2.7) -> -2

-- 1.In this example we calculate the population in millions.

SELECT population/1000000 AS ACTUAL,
       CEIL(population/1000000) AS CEIL,
       FLOOR (population/1000000) AS FLOOR
  FROM world
  WHERE name = 'China'

-- Result:
ACTUAL	CEIL	FLOOR
1411.7500	1412	1411
