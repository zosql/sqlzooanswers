select name from world
where population >=200000000

-- Using CAPS
SELECT name 
FROM world
WHERE population >= 200000000

--Per capita GDP
--3. Give the name and the per capita GDP for those countries with a population of at least 200 million.

select name, gdp/population as "per capita GDP" from world
where population >=200000000

-- Using CAPS
SELECT name, gdp/population AS "per capita GDP" 
FROM world
WHERE population >= 200000000

--South America In millions
--4. Show the name and population in millions for the countries of the continent 'South America'. Divide the population by 1000000 to get population in millions.

select name, population/1000000 from world
where continent = 'South America'

-- CAPS
SELECT name, population/1000000 as 'Population (in mil)'
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'South America'

--France, Germany, Italy

WHERE population > 250000000 XOR
area > 3000000

--Rounding

--For Americas show population in millions and GDP in billions both to 2 decimal places.

select name, round(population/1000000,2), round(gdp/1000000000,2) from world
where continent = 'South America'

-- CAPS
SELECT name, ROUND(population/1000000, 2) as 'Popultn in mil', ROUND(gdp/1000000000, 2) as 'GDP in bil'

FROM world
WHERE gdp > 1000000000000
